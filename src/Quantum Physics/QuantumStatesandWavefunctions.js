        In quantum mechanics, quantum states and wavefunctions play a central role in describing the behavior and properties of quantum systems. A quantum state represents the complete physical description of a system, including all relevant information about its position, momentum, energy, and other observable quantities. The wavefunction, a mathematical function, is used to characterize the quantum state of a system.
