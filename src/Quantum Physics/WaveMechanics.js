                Wave mechanics, also known as wave function mechanics or
                wave theory of matter, is a fundamental framework in quantum
                mechanics that describes the behavior of particles at the
                microscopic level. It was developed in the 1920s, primarily
                by Erwin Schrödinger, as an alternative formulation to
                describe the wave-like nature of particles, such as
                electrons, photons, and other elementary particles.

                        Wave mechanics is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the behavior of particles as waves.
                        It provides the necessary background for understanding quantum phenomena and their implications.

                    <h3 className="font-bold mt-4 text-xl">Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
                    <p className='mt-2 text-lg text-justify'>
                        Wave mechanics embraces the concept of wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. This means that particles, despite being localized entities, also exhibit wave-like behavior, such as interference and diffraction.

            <p className='mt-2 text-lg text-justify'>
                Mathematically, this duality is expressed by the de Broglie wavelength equation:
                ℎλ= ph where: λ is the de Broglie wavelength, ℎ h is Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10−346.62607015×10−34m²kg/s), p is the momentum of the particle.

            <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 text-lg">Schrödinger Equation</h4>
            <p className='mt-2 text-lg text-justify'>
                At the core of wave mechanics lies the Schrödinger equation, a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of quantum states over time. It relates the wave function of a particle to its energy and potential energy within a given physical system. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation governs the dynamics of wave functions, while the time-independent Schrödinger equation is used to find stationary states and energy levels.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by:
                iℏ∂t/∂​Ψ(r,t)= H^Ψ(r,t) where: Ψ(r,t) is the wavefunction, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant (ℎ/2π), ^H^ is the Hamiltonian operator.

            <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 text-lg">Wave Function</h4>
            <p className='mt-2 text-lg text-justify'>
                The wavefunction, often denoted by the symbol Ψ (psi), is a mathematical function that describes the state of a quantum system. It encodes information about the position, momentum, and other observable properties of particles. The square of the absolute value of the wavefunction, |Ψ|², gives the probability density of finding a particle at a specific location in space.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>The wavefunction, often denoted by Ψ(psi), describes the state of a quantum system. It satisfies the normalization condition:∫−∞∞∣Ψ(r,t)∣^2dr=1
            </p>
            <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 text-lg">Probability Interpretation</h4>
            <p className='mt-2 text-lg text-justify'>
                According to wave mechanics, the interpretation of the wavefunction is probabilistic. The probability of finding a particle in a particular region of space is proportional to the square of the magnitude of its wavefunction in that region. This probabilistic interpretation, known as the Born rule, underpins the predictive power of quantum mechanics.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>The square of the absolute value of the wavefunction,∣Ψ∣^2, gives the probability density of finding a particle at a specific location in space. The probability density function is given by: P(r,t)=∣Ψ(r,t)∣^2
            </p>
            <h4 className="font-bold mt-4 text-lg">Wavefunction Collapse</h4>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>When a measurement is made on a quantum system, the wavefunction collapses to a specific state corresponding to the measurement outcome. This phenomenon, known as wavefunction collapse, reflects the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and the role of observation in determining the state of a system.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>The wavefunction collapse is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it is a key aspect of the Copenhagen interpretation, which emphasizes the role of measurement and observation in quantum phenomena.
