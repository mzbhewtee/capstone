            <h3 className='font-bold mt-4 text-xl'>Linear Algebra</h3>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. It provides the necessary tools for describing quantum states, observables, and operators.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Quantum mechanics relies heavily on linear algebra to represent physical systems and their properties. The state of a quantum system is described by a vector in a complex vector space, and observables are represented by linear operators acting on these vectors.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Examples of linear algebra in quantum mechanics include the representation of spin states, wave functions, and the superposition principle.

            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Question:</h4>
            <p>
                Consider the following system of linear equations:
                <b><br></br>2x + y = 5
                <br></br> x - 3y = -2</b>
                <li>Solve the system of equations using the method of your choice (e.g., substitution, elimination).
                </li>
                <li>Determine whether the system has a unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution.
                </li>
                <li>If the system has a unique solution, provide the values of x and y</li>
            </p>
            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of substitution to solve the system:
                <br></br>First, we can solve the second equation for x in terms of y:
                <b><br></br>x = 3y - 2</b>
                <br></br>Next, we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:
                <b><br></br>2(3y - 2) + y = 5
                <br></br>6y - 4 + y = 5
                <br></br>7y - 4 = 5
                <br></br>7y = 9
                <br></br>y = 9/7</b>
                <br></br>Now that we have found the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression for x:
                <b><br></br>x = 3(9/7) - 2
                <br></br>x = 27/7 - 2
                <br></br>x = 27/7 - 14/7
                <br></br>x = 13/7</b>
                <br></br>Therefore, the system of linear equations has a unique solution:
                <b><br></br>x = 13/7 and y = 9/7</b>
            </p>
            <h3 className='font-bold mt-4 text-xl'>Calculus</h3>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation. It provides the necessary tools for describing motion, energy, and probability in quantum systems.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Quantum mechanics relies on calculus to describe the behavior of particles, the evolution of wave functions, and the calculation of expectation values.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Examples of calculus in quantum mechanics include the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the calculation of transition probabilities, and the determination of wave packet spreading.
            </p>
            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Question:</h4>
            <p>
                Consider the function <b>f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4</b>.
                <li>Find the derivative of the function with respect to x.</li>
                <li>Determine the critical points of the function.</li>
                <li>Identify the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.</li>
            </p>
            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                To find the derivative of the function <b>f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4</b>, we can use the power rule for differentiation:
                <b><br></br>f'(x) = 2x + 3</b>
                <br></br>Next, we can set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:
                <b><br></br>2x + 3 = 0
                <br></br>2x = -3
                <br></br>x = -3/2</b>
                <br></br>Now that we have found the critical point, we can test the intervals around it to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing:
                <b><br></br>For x less than -3/2, f'(x) less than 0, so the function is decreasing.
                <br></br>For x greater than -3/2, f'(x) greater than 0, so the function is increasing.</b>
                <br></br>Therefore, the critical point <b>x = -3/2</b> corresponds to a local minimum of the function.
            </p>
            <h3 className='font-bold mt-4 text-xl'>Differential Equations</h3>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe how quantities change over time or space. They provide the necessary tools for modeling physical systems and their behavior.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Quantum mechanics relies on differential equations to describe the time evolution of wave functions, the behavior of quantum systems in external fields, and the calculation of transition amplitudes.
            </p>
            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>

            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Question:</h4>
            <p>
                Consider the following first-order linear differential equation:
                <b><br></br>dy/dx + 2y = 4x</b>
                <li>Find the general solution to the differential equation.</li>
                <li>Determine the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition <b>y(0) = 3</b>.</li>
            </p>
            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                To solve the first-order linear differential equation <b>dy/dx + 2y = 4x</b>, we can use an integrating factor to simplify the equation:
                <b><br></br>Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor e^(∫2dx), we get:
                <br></br>e^(∫2dx) * dy/dx + 2e^(∫2dx) * y = 4x * e^(∫2dx)</b>
                <br></br>Next, we can recognize the left-hand side of the equation as the derivative of the product e^(∫2dx) * y with respect to x:
                <b><br></br>d/dx(e^(∫2dx) * y) = 4x * e^(∫2dx)</b>
                <br></br>Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to x, we obtain the general solution:
                <b><br></br>e^(∫2dx) * y = ∫4x * e^(∫2dx) dx + C
                <br></br>y = e^(-2x) * (∫4x * e^(2x) dx + C)</b>
                <br></br>Now that we have found the general solution, we can determine the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition <b>y(0) = 3</b>:
                <b><br></br>When x = 0, the particular solution becomes:
                <br></br>y(0) = e^0 * (∫4(0) * e^0 dx + C)
                <br></br>3 = 1 * (0 + C)
                <br></br>C = 3</b>
                <br></br>Therefore, the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition is:
                <b><br></br>y = e^(-2x) * (∫4x * e^(2x) dx + 3)</b>
            </p>

            <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
                Quantum mechanics relies on probability theory to describe the statistical nature of measurement outcomes, the uncertainty principle, and the calculation of transition probabilities.

            <p>
                Consider a quantum system with a wave function <b>ψ(x) = A * e^(-x^2/2σ^2)</b>, where A is a normalization constant and σ is the standard deviation.
                <li>Determine the probability density function for the wave function.</li>
                <li>Calculate the probability of finding the particle in the interval <b>x = [-a, a]</b>.</li>
            </p>
            <h4 className='font-bold mt-4 text-lg'>Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                To determine the probability density function for the wave function <b>ψ(x) = A * e^(-x^2/2σ^2)</b>, we can calculate the square of the absolute value of the wave function:
                <b><br></br>|ψ(x)|^2 = |A * e^(-x^2/2σ^2)|^2
                <br></br>= |A|^2 * |e^(-x^2/2σ^2)|^2
                <br></br>= |A|^2 * e^(-x^2/σ^2)</b>
                <br></br>Next, we can normalize the probability density function by integrating it over all space:
                <b><br></br>∫|ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1
                <br></br>∫|A|^2 * e^(-x^2/σ^2) dx = 1</b>
                <br></br>Now that we have found the probability density function, we can calculate the probability of finding the particle in the interval <b>x = [-a, a]</b>:
                <b><br></br>P(-a ≤ x ≤ a) = ∫|ψ(x)|^2 dx
                <br></br>= ∫|A|^2 * e^(-x^2/σ^2) dx
                <br></br>= |A|^2 * ∫e^(-x^2/σ^2) dx</b>
                <br></br>Therefore, the probability of finding the particle in the interval <b>x = [-a, a]</b> is given by the integral of the probability density function over the specified interval.
